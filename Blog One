Getting The Hang of Tweepy & Building Towards SNAP

After running through upwards of 15 potential ChiPy projects over the past two weeks, vetting 
multiple potential data sources, I finally settled on the goal of building an app using twitter data 
that will feature network or sentiment analysis. In short, network analysis comes from a subset 
of mathematics called graph theory and is used to map relationships. In the social sciences, it is 
commonly used to determine the density, structure, and complexities in relationships between 
people in social systems.

With the help of my mentor, I managed to learn the basics of beautifulsoup, the python 
requests library. And finally, one morning before work, in 6 lines of code I pulled the top of my 
twitter timeline using tweepy, a python library for the twitter api.

Having successfully pulled data from twitter’s api, I’ve since transitioned to figuring out how to 
structure my data. In order to run network analysis (specifically, SNAP.py) I need my data 
structured as nodes/vertices (users) and edges/connections (their relationships). For 
simplicity’s sake, I plan to start by building a directed visualization of my relationship to my 
followers using tweepy’s api.followers. Now that I have this depressingly-short list of my twitter 
followers. I can work on assigning them as nodes.
